## ‚ùå Issues Found

### Issue 1: Voice Setup Still Autocompletes (UNCHANGED)
**Problem**:
- AI voice autocompletes the first 10%
- User cannot say "Hello Crafta" themselves
- Cannot continue voice setup

**Status**: ‚ùå NOT FIXED (expected - this is PHASE J)
**Root Cause**: TTS is still triggering speech recognition
**Fix Required**: PHASE J - Disable mic during TTS playback
**Priority**: HIGH

---

### Issue 2: API Key Not Being Used (CRITICAL)
**Problem**:
- User enters API key and saves it
- App still appears to be running offline
- API key doesn't seem to be working

**Status**: ‚ùå NOT WORKING (unexpected - PHASE F should have fixed this)
**Root Cause**: Unknown - needs investigation
**Possible Causes**:
1. ApiKeyService not being called by AI services
2. API key not persisting after save
3. App still using offline fallback even with valid key
4. Key not being loaded on app restart

**Debug Steps Needed**:
1. Check if key is actually saved to secure storage
2. Check if EnhancedAIService is calling ApiKeyService.getApiKey()
3. Check logs to see which mode app is using (online/offline)
4. Verify API key is valid format

**Priority**: CRITICAL - This was the main goal of PHASE F

---

### Issue 3: Language Switching Doesn't Work (CRITICAL)
**Problem**:
- User can select Swedish language in setup
- UI doesn't change to Swedish
- App stays in English

**Status**: ‚ùå NOT WORKING (unexpected)
**Root Cause**: Unknown - needs investigation
**Possible Causes**:
1. Language preference not being saved to SharedPreferences
2. Language not being loaded on app restart
3. AppLocalizations not being updated after language change
4. MaterialApp not rebuilding with new locale

**Debug Steps Needed**:
1. Check if language code is saved in SharedPreferences
2. Check if LanguageService is loading the preference
3. Check if locale is being set in MaterialApp
4. Verify translations exist in AppLocalizations

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Major UX issue

## üîß Critical Fixes Needed

### Fix 1: API Key Not Being Used (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Investigation Required**:
1. Check ApiKeyService.saveApiKey() is working
2. Check EnhancedAIService is calling _getApiKey()
3. Add more logging to see which mode is active
4. Test API key validation

**Files to Check**:
- `lib/services/api_key_service.dart`
- `lib/services/enhanced_ai_service.dart`
- `lib/screens/first_run_setup_screen.dart`

**Possible Quick Fix**:
```dart
// In EnhancedAIService, add more logging:
final apiKey = await _getApiKey();
print('üîë API KEY STATUS: ${apiKey != null ? 'FOUND' : 'NOT FOUND'}');
print('üîë API KEY PREFIX: ${apiKey?.substring(0, 7)}...');
```

---

### Fix 2: Language Switching Not Working

**Investigation Required**:
1. Check LanguageService implementation
2. Verify SharedPreferences save/load
3. Check MaterialApp locale configuration
4. Test AppLocalizations rebuild

**Files to Check**:
- `lib/services/language_service.dart`
- `lib/main.dart` (locale configuration)
- `lib/screens/first_run_setup_screen.dart` (language save)

**Possible Quick Fix**:
```dart
// In FirstRunSetupScreen, after language selection:
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
await prefs.setString('language_code', code);
print('üí¨ Language saved: $code');

// Then restart app or rebuild MaterialApp with new locale
```

### Fix 3: Voice Setup (PHASE J - Lower Priority)

**Status**: Deferred to PHASE J
**Reason**: This is a known issue, not a regression
**Fix**: Disable microphone during TTS playback

---

## üéØ Revised Priority Order

Based on testing results:

1. **Fix API Key Usage** (CRITICAL - 1-2 hours)
   - PHASE F main feature not working
   - User cannot use online AI
   - Most important fix

2. **Fix Language Switching** (CRITICAL - 1 hour)
   - Major UX issue
   - Blocks Swedish users
   - Should be quick fix

3. **Fix Minecraft Export** (CRITICAL - 2-3 hours)
   - Original PHASE G
   - User cannot export creations
   - Still high priority

4. **Fix Voice Setup** (HIGH - 30 min)
   - Original PHASE J
   - Annoying but not blocking
   - Quick fix available

5. **Fix Preview Rendering** (HIGH - 1-2 hours)
   - Original PHASE I
   - User experience issue

6. **Fix Creation History** (MEDIUM - 1-2 hours)
   - Original PHASE H
   - Nice to have

## üìù For Next AI Session

### Immediate Action Items

1. **Debug API Key Issue**
   - Add extensive logging
   - Test key persistence
   - Verify EnhancedAIService integration
   - Test with real API calls

2. **Debug Language Issue**
   - Check SharedPreferences save/load
   - Verify locale changes
   - Test UI updates

3. **Create Quick Fix Commit**
   - Fix both critical issues
   - Test thoroughly
   - Build new APK

### Testing Checklist for Next Build

- [ ] API key saved after setup
- [ ] API key loads on app restart
- [ ] EnhancedAIService uses online mode with key
- [ ] Language preference saves
- [ ] Language preference loads on restart
- [ ] UI changes to Swedish when selected
- [ ] Voice setup still needs PHASE J fix (expected)

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Integration testing is critical**
   - Code compiles ‚â† features work
   - Need to test on real device
   - End-to-end flows must be tested

2. **Logging is essential**
   - Need more debug output
   - Track state transitions
   - Verify data persistence

3. **Phase dependencies matter**
   - PHASE F builds on existing code
   - Must test all integration points
   - Cannot assume existing code works correctly

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. Fix API key usage (highest priority)
2. Fix language switching
3. Build and test new APK
4. Continue with remaining phases

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-3 hours
**New APK Expected**: After fixes
