# 🌈 Crafta - AI-Powered Minecraft Mod Creator for Kids

**Voice-first iOS app that turns children's imagination into real Minecraft Bedrock mods**

> "If you can say it, you can make it."

---

## 🎯 What is Crafta?

Crafta is an iOS application designed for children ages 4-10 that allows them to create Minecraft Bedrock Edition mods using only their voice. Kids speak naturally about what they want to create, and Crafta's friendly AI helps bring their ideas to life—no coding required.

**Example:**
- Child: "I want a rainbow cow that sparkles!"
- Crafta: "Cool! Should it be tiny or huge?"
- Child: "Tiny!"
- *30 seconds later, the mod is ready to import into Minecraft*

2. **Voice Output** - TTS reads responses warmly
3. **Content Generation** - Structured prompts generate mod JSON

### AI Safety Features
- Child-safe language filtering
- Positive reinforcement only
- No violent or scary content
- Parent-approved responses

See [Crafta_AI_Rules.md](Crafta_AI_Rules.md) for complete AI guidelines.

## 💡 Example Use Cases

### Creative Play
"I want a dragon that's pink and loves cookies!"
→ Crafta creates a friendly pink dragon entity

### Educational
"Can you make a cow that glows in the dark?"
→ Teaches cause and effect, attributes

### Storytelling
"I need a tiny pig with wings for my adventure"
→ Encourages narrative thinking

See [CONCEPT_DOCUMENT.md](CONCEPT_DOCUMENT.md) for more examples.

- **No tracking** - No analytics in MVP
- **Local processing** - Voice stays on device
- **Parent controls** - All sharing requires approval

### Content Safety
- AI filtered for age-appropriateness
- No violence, fear, or negative themes
- Pre-moderated attribute options
- Parent review of all creations

See [Crafta_AI_Rules.md](Crafta_AI_Rules.md) for safety protocols.
