## Troubleshooting

### No Voice Heard
**Problem**: Announcements silent
**Solution**:
- Check device volume is not muted
- Check TTS is enabled in system settings
- Try headphones instead of speaker
- Restart app

### Preview Doesn't Update
**Problem**: "Make Changes" doesn't show new preview
**Solution**:
- Check internet (AI needs API access)
- Check API key is set (.env file)
- Wait longer (AI can be slow)
- Check logs for errors

### Modification Dialog Doesn't Appear
**Problem**: Click "Make Changes" but nothing happens
**Solution**:
- Device might have animation delays
- Try waiting 5 seconds
- Restart app
- Check logs for errors

### Minecraft Won't Launch
**Problem**: "Launching Minecraft..." but nothing happens
**Solution**:
- Minecraft not installed (expected)
- Try installing Minecraft
- Check if app was freshly installed
- Look for .mcpack file in Downloads

   - Errors handled gracefully?

4. **Export**

   - Launch works?
