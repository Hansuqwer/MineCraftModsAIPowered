# Phase 5+ Critical Issues & Action Plan

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Status**: ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
**Build**: ✅ APK compiles successfully (67.1MB)

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Voice Setup Not Working ❌
**Impact**: HIGH - Core feature broken
**Symptoms**:
- Voice calibration/setup isn't functioning
- Voice input isn't being captured properly
- No voice output feedback

**Root Cause**:
- Voice services are implemented but not properly integrated into main flow
- Speech recognition needs initialization check
- TTS output needs verification

**Files to Review**:
- `lib/screens/voice_calibration_screen.dart` - Setup screen
- `lib/services/speech_service.dart` - Speech recognition
- `lib/services/tts_service.dart` - Text-to-speech
- `lib/screens/enhanced_creator_basic.dart` - Test screen (working)

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Debug speech service initialization
- [ ] Add logging to voice pipeline
- [ ] Test microphone permissions
- [ ] Verify TTS initialization
- [ ] Add fallback audio test

---

### Issue #2: 3D View Not Rendering ❌
**Impact**: HIGH - No visual feedback
**Symptoms**:
- Creature preview shows blank/white screen
- No 3D model displayed after creation
- WebView might not be loading properly

**Root Cause**:
- Babylon.js HTML generation may have issues
- WebView communication not working
- Model JSON generation failing

**Files to Review**:
- `lib/widgets/minecraft_3d_preview.dart` - WebView widget
- `lib/widgets/simple_3d_preview.dart` - Fallback preview
- `lib/services/minecraft/geometry_generator.dart` - Model generation

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Test WebView initialization
- [ ] Verify Babylon.js HTML is valid
- [ ] Check model JSON output
- [ ] Add fallback 2D preview
- [ ] Test on actual device

---

### Issue #3: Export to Minecraft Not Working ❌
**Impact**: HIGH - Can't save creations
**Symptoms**:
- Export button doesn't work
- .mcpack file not created
- Files not saved to device

**Root Cause**:
- Export service may have implementation gaps
- File permissions issues
- Manifest/JSON generation errors

**Files to Review**:
- `lib/services/minecraft_export_service.dart` - Main export logic
- `lib/services/minecraft/manifest_generator.dart` - UUID/manifest
- `lib/services/minecraft/entity_behavior_generator.dart` - Behavior JSON
- Test results show: `minecraft:movement.fly` missing from behavior pack

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Fix behavior pack JSON generation
- [ ] Verify file permissions
- [ ] Test mcpack creation
- [ ] Add download confirmation
- [ ] Test on real device import

---

### Issue #4: Not Voice-First for Non-Readers ⚠️
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Core design not implemented
**Symptoms**:
- UI has text elements (names, labels)
- Buttons require reading ability
- Not designed for 4-10 year olds who can't read

**Current Reality**:
- WelcomeScreen -> CreatorScreenSimple (mixed voice/text)
- EnhancedCreatorBasic exists but is a test screen
- No pure voice-first flow established

**Ideal Flow** (for non-readers):
```
App Start
  ↓
[VOICE] "Hi! I'm Crafta! What do you want to create today?"
  ↓ (Child speaks)
"Let me help you make a [cow/sword/house]!"
  ↓
[VOICE] "What color do you want it? Say red, blue, or green!"
  ↓ (Child speaks)
[VOICE] "Oh, beautiful! Let me show you..."
  ↓
[3D Preview shows the creation]
  ↓
[VOICE] "Do you like it? Say yes to save it to Minecraft!"
  ↓
[Export & Complete]
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create true voice-first creator screen
- [ ] Remove reading requirements
- [ ] Add audio prompts for every step
- [ ] Implement emoji/icon-only UI
- [ ] Add personality feedback

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 5.1: Fix Core Voice Functionality (2-3 hours)
**Goal**: Get speech-to-text and text-to-speech working reliably

1. Debug speech service initialization
2. Add voice setup validation
3. Test TTS output
4. Create voice test utilities
5. Commit: "fix: Restore voice setup functionality"

### Phase 5.2: Fix 3D Rendering (2-3 hours)
**Goal**: Show creature 3D model in preview

1. Test Babylon.js HTML generation
2. Verify WebView loading
3. Add fallback 2D preview
4. Test model JSON output
5. Commit: "fix: Enable 3D creature preview rendering"

### Phase 5.3: Fix Minecraft Export (2-3 hours)
**Goal**: Enable saving to .mcpack files

1. Fix behavior pack JSON (add minecraft:movement.fly)
2. Test manifest generation
3. Verify file creation
4. Test device import
5. Commit: "fix: Restore Minecraft export functionality"

### Phase 5.4: Implement Voice-First Creator (4-5 hours)

## Test Coverage Gaps

Current test failures:
- `educational_voice_service_test.dart` - Compilation errors
- `minecraft_export_service_test.dart` - Missing minecraft:movement.fly

**TODO**:
- [ ] Fix test compilation errors
- [ ] Add 57+ passing tests back to green
- [ ] Add specific tests for export functionality
- [ ] Add speech service integration tests

---

## Success Criteria

### Voice Setup ✅
- [ ] Microphone input captured
- [ ] AI response generated
- [ ] Voice output plays
- [ ] Can switch personalities
- [ ] User hears personality in response

### 3D Rendering ✅
- [ ] Babylon.js scene loads
- [ ] Creature model displays
- [ ] Can rotate/zoom model
- [ ] Fallback 2D shows if WebView fails
- [ ] Performance acceptable

### Minecraft Export ✅
- [ ] .mcpack file created
- [ ] Manifest has valid UUIDs
- [ ] Behavior pack has all required components
- [ ] Can import to Minecraft
- [ ] Creature spawns correctly

### Voice-First Experience ✅
- [ ] Child can create item by voice alone
- [ ] No reading required
- [ ] Audio prompts guide through process
- [ ] Visual feedback via emoji/icons
- [ ] 4-10 year olds can use independently

## Notes for Next Session

1. Start with Phase 5.1 (Voice functionality) - it's the most critical
2. Use EnhancedCreatorBasic as reference - it has working voice integration
3. Look at test results carefully - they hint at actual issues
4. Test on real Android device (emulators don't support audio well)
5. Consider starting fresh voice-first screen instead of patching existing
