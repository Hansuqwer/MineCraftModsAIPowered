# This would be a 128x128 PNG texture file
# For now, creating a placeholder that indicates where the texture should be
# In a real implementation, this would be a proper PNG file with:
# - Dark charcoal black body (#101010)
# - Green scales (#007F00 with lighter green highlights)
# - Glowing red eyes (#FF0000)
# - Proper UV mapping for the dragon geometry
