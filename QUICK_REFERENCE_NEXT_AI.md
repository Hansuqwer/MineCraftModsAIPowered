## 🚨 **CRITICAL: What You Need to Know**

### 1. **The App Uses `AIService`, NOT `EnhancedAIService`**
- **File**: `lib/services/ai_service.dart`
- **Why**: This was the main issue - I initially fixed the wrong service
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed with enhanced system prompt

### 2. **ARB Files Must Be Valid JSON**
- **Files**: `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`, `lib/l10n/app_sv.arb`
- **Why**: Previous attempts failed due to JSON formatting
- **Status**: ✅ Recreated with proper structure

### 3. **Language Loading is Asynchronous**
- **File**: `lib/main.dart`
- **Why**: Blocking language loading caused grey screen
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - app starts immediately

## 🔧 **Key Files to Check**

### Most Important
1. `lib/services/ai_service.dart` - Main AI service (FIXED)
2. `lib/l10n/app_*.arb` - Translation files (FIXED)
3. `lib/main.dart` - App startup (FIXED)

### Other Important
- `lib/services/kid_voice_service.dart` - Voice input
- `lib/services/language_service.dart` - Language management
- `lib/screens/tutorial_screen.dart` - Tutorial UI

---

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### ✅ What Should Work Now
1. **App Startup**: Immediate, no grey screen
2. **Language Switching**: Complete Swedish translation
3. **AI Item Creation**: 
   - "blue sword" → Creates blue sword
   - "dragon with red eyes and it should be black" → Creates black dragon with red eyes
   - "red chair" → Creates red chair
   - "golden helmet" → Creates golden helmet

### 🔍 Debug Output to Look For
```
🔑 [AI_SERVICE] API Keys loaded: - OpenAI: ✅
🤖 [AI_SERVICE] Initializing AI service...
🚀 [AI_SERVICE] Using OpenAI API with key: sk-proj-...
✅ [AI_SERVICE] OpenAI response received
```

## 📋 **If Issues Persist**

### Check These First
1. **API Key**: Is it properly saved and loaded?
2. **Debug Output**: Are you seeing the AI service debug messages?
3. **Language**: Is the app switching to Swedish completely?
4. **Startup**: Does the app start immediately?

### Common Fixes
1. **Import Errors**: Check class names match actual files
2. **ARB Formatting**: Ensure valid JSON structure
3. **Async Operations**: Don't block UI with await calls
4. **API Key Flow**: Check error handling
