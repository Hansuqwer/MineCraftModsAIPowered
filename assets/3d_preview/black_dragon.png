# This is a placeholder for the black_dragon.png texture file
# In a real implementation, this would be a 128x128 PNG image
# with the following features:
# - Dark black scales for the body
# - Green scale highlights
# - Glowing red eyes
# - Wing membrane texture
# - Tail and horn details
# 
# To create a real texture, you would:
# 1. Use a pixel art editor (Aseprite, GIMP, etc.)
# 2. Create a 128x128 texture with Minecraft-style pixel art
# 3. Include UV mapping for the dragon model
# 4. Replace this placeholder file
