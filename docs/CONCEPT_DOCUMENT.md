## üé¨ The "Movie Trailer" Pitch

> "Meet Emma, age 6. She loves Minecraft but wishes it had pink dolphins.
>
> She opens Crafta and says: 'I want a pink dolphin that jumps really high.'
>
> Crafta asks: 'Should it have sparkles?'
>
> Emma: 'Yes! And make it tiny!'
>
> 30 seconds later, Emma's playing with her creation.
>
> No tutorials. No coding. Just imagination."

**That's Crafta. Where every kid is a game designer.**

---

- Faster results
- Designed for younger kids

**vs. Scratch / Tynker:**
- No coding syntax to learn
- Natural language only
- Immediate Minecraft integration
- Voice > visual blocks

**vs. Roblox Studio:**
- Much simpler

## üß© Design Philosophy Summary

### The Three Pillars

**1. Playfulness**
The AI feels like a friend, not a tool.

**2. Empowerment**
Kids feel *they* made the mod, even though AI did the heavy lifting.

**3. Imagination-First**
Encourage "what if?" questions, not correctness.

### The Golden Rule
**"If it's not safe, kind, and imaginative ‚Äî it's not Crafta."**
