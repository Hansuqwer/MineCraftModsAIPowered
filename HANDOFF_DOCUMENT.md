---

### PHASE I: Fix Preview Rendering (HIGH - 1-2 hours)

**Problem**: Preview shows happy face instead of proper creature

**Implementation**:
1. Debug current CreaturePreview widget
2. Enhance ProceduralCreatureRenderer
3. Add creature-specific shapes (dragon, cat, bird, etc.)
4. Add body parts (wings, tail, horns, scales)
5. Test with online and offline modes

**Files to Modify**:
- `lib/widgets/procedural_creature_renderer.dart`
- `lib/widgets/creature_preview.dart`

**Success Criteria**:
- Dragons look like dragons
- Cats look like cats

- Works in both online/offline

---

### PHASE J: Voice Calibration + UI Cleanup (MEDIUM - 30 min)

**Problem**: Voice autocompletes, too many buttons, no language switcher

**Implementation**:
1. Fix voice calibration (disable mic during TTS)
2. Remove "Choose what to create" button
3. Remove "Quick start creature" button
4. Rename "Kid mode" to "Start Creating"
5. Add language selector to welcome screen

**Files to Modify**:
