# 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

## 🚨 **ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

### 1. **Blue Object Issue** ❌ → ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: 3D preview showing blue generic object instead of correct model
**Root Cause**: Model detection failing, falling back to generic model
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive debugging to see what `baseType` is being detected
- Improved generic model with better fallback logic
- Added specific detection for common items (cat, table, sword, etc.)

### 2. **AI Suggestions Not Appearing** ❌ → ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: No AI suggestions showing up
**Root Cause**: Suggestion generation might be failing silently
**Solution**:
- Added debug logging to track suggestion generation
- Improved error handling in suggestion flow
- Enhanced voice response processing

### 3. **Microphone Only Saying "Listening Yes/No"** ❌ → ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Voice commands not working properly
**Root Cause**: Speech service not processing full voice commands
**Solution**:
- Enhanced voice command processing
- Better prompting for user responses
- Improved speech recognition flow
