# This is a placeholder for the black_dragon.glb file
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLB file
# containing the 3D mesh data for the black dragon
# 
# To create a real GLB file, you would:
# 1. Use Blender, Blockbench, or similar 3D software
# 2. Create a Minecraft-style dragon model
# 3. Export as GLB format
# 4. Replace this placeholder file
