## 🔧 **All Critical Issues Fixed**

### 1. AI Understanding Fixed ✅

- Updated system prompt to handle ALL Minecraft item types
- AI now uses EXACTLY what the child asks for
- Added comprehensive debugging

### 2. Language Switching Fixed ✅
**Problem**: Mixed Swedish/English text in settings screens and tutorial
**Solution**:
- Added missing translations for all settings screens
- Added complete tutorial translations
- All UI elements now properly translate to Swedish

### 3. Grey Screen Fixed ✅
**Problem**: App showed grey screen on startup
**Solution**:
- Removed blocking language loading
- App starts immediately with English
- Language loads in background and updates UI

### 4. API Key Usage Fixed ✅
**Problem**: API key not being used despite being saved
**Solution**:
- Fixed the actual `AIService` that the app uses
- Enhanced debugging throughout the flow
- Fixed import issues and method calls
