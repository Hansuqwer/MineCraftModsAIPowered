# STEP 1: Voice Testing Guide

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Objective**: Verify Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech work correctly
**Location**: Navigate to `/voice-test` screen in app

---

## Pre-Testing Checklist

- [ ] Android device (real device, not emulator - emulators don't support audio well)
- [ ] Microphone working on device
- [ ] Speaker/headphones working
- [ ] APK built from code cleanup version
- [ ] Internet connection (may be needed for some voice APIs)
- [ ] Location: Quiet environment (for speech recognition accuracy)

---

## Testing Infrastructure

We've created a **VoiceTestScreen** specifically for this testing phase. It shows:

1. **Service Status**
   - ‚úÖ Speech-to-Text initialized
   - ‚úÖ Text-to-Speech initialized

2. **Individual Tests**
   - Test Speech Input (listen for 15 seconds)
   - Test TTS: "Hello" message
   - Test TTS: "Celebration" message

3. **Integration Test**
   - Complete Voice Loop (speak ‚Üí AI listens ‚Üí AI responds ‚Üí AI speaks back)

4. **Live Test Log**
   - Real-time output of what's happening
   - Shows errors and successes

## How to Access

### Option A: Direct Route
If you have debug mode enabled, you can navigate directly:
```
App ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí (URL bar or menu) ‚Üí /voice-test
```

### Option B: Via Routes
In the app code, the route is registered as:
```dart
'/voice-test': (context) => const VoiceTestScreen(),
```

### Option C: From Terminal (if running via Flutter)
```bash
flutter run -d <device-id>
# Then press 't' in terminal and type: /voice-test
```

## Test Log Interpretation

### Good Log Examples

‚úÖ Speech successful:
```
‚úÖ Speech recognized: hello crafta
```

‚úÖ TTS successful:
```
üîä Speaking: "Hello! This is Crafta speaking!"
‚úÖ Text spoken successfully
```

‚úÖ Services initialized:
```
‚úÖ Both services ready!

```

‚ùå Service not initialized:
```
‚ùå Speech service not initialized
Speech-to-Text: ‚ùå Failed
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "Speech service not initialized"
**Cause**: SpeechService failed to initialize
**Solution**:
1. Check microphone permissions in device Settings
2. Restart app
3. Try on real device (not emulator)
4. Check if `speech_to_text` plugin is properly installed

### Issue: "Listening..." but nothing happens
**Cause**: Speech recognition timeout or no audio detected
**Solution**:
1. Speak loudly and clearly
2. Try in quieter environment
3. Check microphone is not muted
4. Wait full 15 seconds

### Issue: Hear no audio output
**Cause**: TTS not working
**Solution**:
1. Check device volume (not muted)
2. Check speaker/headphone connected
3. Verify TTS permissions
4. Restart app

### Issue: "High confidence result ignored"
**Cause**: Voice detected but below 30% confidence threshold
**Solution**:
1. Speak more clearly
2. Reduce background noise
3. Speak closer to microphone
4. Try slower, more deliberate speech

### Issue: Numbers or symbols in recognized text
**Cause**: Speech recognition misheard words
**Solution**:
- This is normal for similar-sounding words
- Try again or enunciate more clearly

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Device, not Emulator**: Flutter emulators often don't support audio APIs well. Use a real Android device.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Permissions**: App may request microphone permission on first run. Grant it.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Network**: Some voice APIs need internet connection. Ensure device is connected.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Timing**: Allow 15-20 seconds between tests for services to process.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Quiet Environment**: Speech recognition works best with minimal background noise.

## Next Steps After STEP 1

**If all tests pass** ‚úÖ:
- Continue to STEP 2: 3D Rendering testing
- Voice system is working correctly

**If some tests fail** ‚ö†Ô∏è:
- Document which tests failed
- Review troubleshooting guide
- Retry with adjustments
- Report issues for debugging

**If all tests fail** ‚ùå:
- Check device setup (microphone, speaker)
- Verify permissions granted
- Check internet connection
- Try restarting app
- Contact support with test logs
